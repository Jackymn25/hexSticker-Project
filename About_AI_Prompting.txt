User: Offered skeleton image(assets/skeleton.png)
Fill the upper block and the right block with solid colors.
In the upper block, place the R language logo. The R logo should be connected in a network style to other statistical elements (like in image 2), but replace the circles with statistical charts, formula symbols, etc.
In the right block, create the figure of a data scientist, also with a solid background.

This image — can you adjust the tilt of this small element so that it looks more natural and fits the 3D design feel?

User:
Please fix this image — don’t change anything else, just remove the white defect at the corner.

User:
I only need the top part. Keep the complete shape — but you cropped the corners off earlier.

Assistant (Image Generated, Full Shape Preserved)

User:
Sharpen the whole image. Some of the text looks pixelated. Don’t crop it, don’t change the outline or shape — just enhance the clarity of the text.

Summarize the prompt process that led to generating this image.


Another chat section:
First request:
You asked to place the content of the second image (a blue R/statistics icon) onto the top surface of the first image (an orange cube showing STA258 Fall 2025 course details).

Result: The AI generated an orange 3D cube with the R/statistics symbol on the top face, keeping the course info text and original 3D perspective.

Second request:
You asked to add data science–related illustrations on the right face, change its background color to pink, and maintain the 3D structure without altering the cube’s skeleton.

Result: The AI generated a cube with the right face in pink, decorated with data science visuals (such as charts and symbols), preserving the isometric/3D look.
